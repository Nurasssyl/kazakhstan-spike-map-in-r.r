# Kazakhstan's population density

![](kazakhstan_population_2023.png)

I have compiled a population density map of Kazakhstan for January 2024 

I developed this visualization in the R language using the libraries: tidyverse, R.utils, httr, sf, stars, rayshader

My observations:

1. Peaks in large cities and urbanized areas such as Almaty, Shymkent and regional centers are clearly highlighted on the map, which indicates a high population density. 🌆

2. Most of the map shows few or no peaks, indicating low population density in the steppe and desert regions of Western and Central Kazakhstan. 🌾

3. Clusters of peaks are visible, probably corresponding to industrial areas, small towns or suburban areas, such as the monotowns of Satpayev and Arkalyk. 🏘️

4. The southern part of Kazakhstan, including Almaty and Shymkent, has a high population density, as can be seen from the large and frequent peaks. 🏙️

5. Clusters of high peaks are observed along major transport corridors such as railways and motorways, indicating a dense population along these paths. 🚉

6. In the central and western regions of Kazakhstan, peaks are rare and low due to less favorable living conditions such as deserts and steppes. 🏜️

7. In the south-east of the country, in the mountainous regions of Alatau, there is a lower population density due to inaccessibility and difficult living conditions. 🏔️

8. In the central regions, including Astana and Karaganda, clusters of high population density are observed, which makes them important economic and administrative centers. 🏢

9. High peaks in some areas are associated with industrial activity, for example, in the oil and gas regions in western Kazakhstan, which attract labor. ⚒️
